a)
The start state of the DFA would be equivalent to the states {1, 4}.

b)
The states {3,4}, {5,6}, and {3,5,6} are accept states.

c)
In the DFA, delta ({3,4}, 0) is the transition leading from the state equilavent to the states {3,4} to the state equivalent to the states {1,3,4,6} after accepting the character '0'.

d)
In the DFA, delta({3,5,6}, 0) is the transition leading from the state equivalent to the states {3, 5, 6} to the state equivalent to the states {1,3,4,5,6} after accepting the character '0'.
