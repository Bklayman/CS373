To prove that 2^2 < n! for all n > 3, we will use induction.

Base Case: n = 4

2^4 = 16             4! = 24

Since 16 < 24, the base case is correct.

Induction Hypothesis:
Assume that 2^2 < n! for some n > 3.

Induction Step:
We want to prove that if the induction hypothesis is true for some n > 3, then 2^n+1 < (n+1)!.

2^n+1 = 2^n * 2           Definition of exponent
      < n! * 2            Induction Hypothesis
      < n! * (n+1)        2 < n+1 for all n > 3
      = (n+1)!            Definition of factorial

So, we can say that 2^n+1 < (n+1)! if 2^2 < n! for some n > 3.

Since the base case n=4 and the induction step of n+1 assuming n both function correctly, we can say that 2^n < n! for all integers n greater than 3.
