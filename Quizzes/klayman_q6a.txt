a)

1)
To convert to a GNFA, two states need to be added. One added state is the new start state and the other added state is an accept state.
The original start state is modified to no longer be the start state. All former accept states are modified to no longer be accept states.

2)
An epsilon transition needs to be added from the new start state to the former start state.
Epsilon transitions need to be added from every former accept state to the new accept state.

3)
The transition from 1 to 3 needs to be modified to be the union of 0 and 1.
The self-loop at 5 needs to be modified to be the union of 0, 1, and 2.

b)
The resulting transition from 1 to 3 after removing 4 would accept "(01^*(01)^*(0 U 1)) U epsilon".

c)
The resulting transition from 1 to 4 after removing 2 would accept "(01^*) U (10^*11)".
