x = 1^m
y = 1^n
z = 1^(p-m-n)0^p2^p
xy^0z = 1^(p-n)0^p2^p
xy^2z = 1^(p+n)0^p2^p
brief explanation: This does not work because in both of these situations, the number of 0s can still divide the sum of the number of 1s and 2s.
For some pumping lengths p, p can divide 2p-m-n or 2p+n, so both i=0 and i=2 could fail, along with any other choice of i.
